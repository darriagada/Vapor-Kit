## About
I'm very much nostalgic for older systems interfaces and retro artworks and sometimes you need a quick template to showcase something. These are my favorite ones.

### Disclaimer
As you can see, these are not 1:1 recreations, I took some creative liberties due to retina resolutions where older UIs look tiny compared to CRT screens. But they do the trick.

Have fun! ⚡️
